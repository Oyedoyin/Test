Hi Dada,
I just sent you a recent export of the fixed system.
First I need you to try and import as you will from the package manager and configure the input from Oyedoyin/Common/Setup Input...see if everything goes right.
Then try and set up a new model using one of the tutorials on YT.
The piston engine/propeller system is a complex model I'm testing out. You can configure the Throttle, Mixture and Propeller Pitch axes from the Input manager
